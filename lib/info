This mud is different from the standard Diku setup.  The setting is placed
in the future, where a CyberPunk theme takes hold.  The story is that of
society split between that of technology and religion.  There are 7 worlds,
each world containing about 5 areas.  To reach other worlds, you must
teleport (enter portals or teleporters) to the starship orbitting your 
current planet, which will take you there.  Go buy maps of the different
worlds in world Technopolis (in city shire).

Mortals cant mentally tell to other mortals, except to gods.
If this irritates you, then consider purchasing a communication device,
which allows you to communicate with other mortals just as effectively.
There are beepers, cellular phones, and phone booths for your convenience.
Do a help on 'call'.

About religion: You can 'sacrifice' things to the gods, which will award
you with experience.  Also, if you are in dire straits, consider using
the 'god' command, which will notify gods of your situation immediately.
Of course, the gods do not have to help you.  When your deeds are
excellent, you may occasionally receive AWARD previlege, indicating can 
go to the altar and pray from gifts.  Newbies to the mud can usually obtain
a NEWBIE previlege and pray at the altar for a newbie package.  Ask the gods
for this.  That's it for now.  Do a 'help' and 'news' much more exciting stuff.
