NOTE: tinyworld.shp file differs from standard Diku.  It produces 6 items.

IF YOU MODIFY DELETE OR ADD ROOMS in the tinyworld.wld file, you must
execute 'hunt' (located in the parent directory of this one).  What it will
do is regenerate hunt.table to reflect the changes you made.  Also, go into
db.h (located in the parent directory of this one) and change the MAXROOM
variable located at the top to reflect any room additions or deletions.  It
need not be exact, just GREATER than the number of rooms you have.  Note I
mean number of rooms, not max room number in the tinyworld.wld file.  It is
currently in the 600's.  After you do the change, type make again to compile
it.  NOTE: run 'hunt' BEFORE you run testserver.  But you need not run hunt
if you did not change the tinyworld.wld file.  REMEMBER this note, or one day
your mud may crash.  NOTE2: the 'hunt' executable takes a LONG time to
finish if you have a large world file, so be patient.  PHL
