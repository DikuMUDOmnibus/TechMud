The hills~
   You are on a small bewildered path winding its way between the hills in
lack of better things to do. To the south you have a splendid view over the
flat, vast, desolate plains. To the north the hills grow steadily darker and
foreboding. This is the cause of no sunset, it is rather the power of evil
penetrating these quiet hills. Glancing around you notice only a single bird.

The hills~
   You are surrounded by dark and sinister hills. Although they seemed fairly
small from a distance you now get the feeling that they're closing in on you,
towering over you, overwhelming you...
The small path seems to have second thoughts about these hills because it
starts winding unnecessarily, turning several times around itself.
To the south the hills have a lighter hue of dark. To the north however, the
hills have become nightblack holes in the distant mountains.

End of the path~
   At this point the path has had enough. With a terrified shudder it cowers
to the ground, only staying here because you're standing on it. with a slight
feeling of unease you look around noticing only a few bushes and a large sign
carved into the mountain.
You feel you can hear the cry of help from a thousand silent voices all coming
from an even darker hole in the mountain to the north marking the entrance to
a cave (or a grave :-).

The cave~
   You are in a large cave. The ceiling is lost somewhere above the reach of
your light. The floor, however, is highly illuminated, your light flickering
over several tombstones. Only one is whole, the rest have been shattered by
some savage blow. The remaining tombstone looks disturbingly new...
A small breeze of fresh air enters from the south (probably lost too). Take a
good breath, it may be your last mouthful of air in a long, long time that
others haven't breathed before you.
To the north a small tunnel continues into the mountain.

Most of the books are heavy, leatherbound and covered in a thin layer of dust.
There are many titles on necromancy, conjuring and other spheres of Magick,
but also some on computer science (although these seem to be VERY dusty
indeed) and a fair collection of horror literature, ranging from Bram Stoker
and H. P. Lovecraft to Anne Rice and Stephen King.

  Please do not try to attract the attention of any

ground ledge rock~
The ground here seems a little different from all the other ledges along the
Abyss. There's a kind of soft soil on this ledge, maybe you should look 
carefully at this. It seems to be of some interest.

soil soft earth~
You can just make out the outline of a trapdoor here in the soil. The earth
is probably there to conceal a secret entrance. This looks as if it leads down
into the seemingly solid rock face of the ledge.

You are in the progress of walking all the way around the ledge since there's
no way of turning around on this all too narrow path. There IS another exit

The Entrance to the Realm of silence~
This is an utterly silent place. As you look around you see that there
hasn't been a living thing in a long time. The dust lies here in a thick

These runes are utterly strange to you, but you are in luck today: Under
the runes you can just make out a sentence in Common. It goes : " Stay out,
if you treasure your life. That is if you are mortal.".

Zeus's Library~
This is truly a magnificent place! Books and scrolls lie together on every
shelf. A large globe, with the map of the Mud-world upon it, stands in the
dimly lit north-western corner of the room. Two large and comfortable-
looking leather arm-chairs adourn the center of the library together with
a huge oak desk. Dim light radiates from an enormous crystal chandelier
hanging down from the ceiling approximately 10 feet off the floor. To the
east there is a great old ashen door. A large glass window is set in the
west wall.

globe world map~
You see a large world map stretch out on the enormous globe. It has towns
drawn in every spot available for such. In the middle of the map you can
spot a large town with the name 'Technopolis' written over it. The rest is
mountains, woods, plains and water.

Technopolis town city~
You see a small speck with woods on the west from it, plains to the east
from it and mountains to the north from it. To the south from it you can
see a thin trail lead to a large castle. Finally you notice a rather large
river pour in from the east and go through Technopolis in the middle.

These two chair are exactly alike one another. They look incredibly

that they can be nothing but a perfect place for a long needed rest.

window glass~
These windows are really BIG! They reach from about 20 inches above the
floor to approximately 10 inches under the ceiling. If you try and
"look out", you might see what might lie beyond these windows.

The clouds muster and form the ground on which this entire building is set.
Through the thinnest of the clouds you can just make out Technopolis with all
it's magnificent activity.

river~
You see a large and winding river cut through the landscape, starting at an
enormous inland lake, it seeps through Technopolis and finally ends up in the
Grand Sea on the West-coast of the land.

The Artifact room of Olympus~
This is gloomy and dark room with only a faint light radiating from the
walls. A bunch of funny-looking items fill the center of the room. There are
no furniture here what-so-ever. The only way out seems to be west, through
the low steel door.

The Northern end of the hall~
You are standing in the northern end of the huge hall. This part is under
the grand wooden staircase so the light seems a little less bright here,
but this doesn't bother your sight at all. To the north lies the kitchen.
To the south lies the Southern end of the hall. To the east there is a huge
metal door. To the west there is a large aspenwood door.

most awful experience in your entire life. A thought seeps through this
terrible stench and into your mind : "Monsters", you feel BAD about opening
that door.

The Sitting room of Olympus~
You are standing in the middle of a really comfortable place. The walls are
decorated with paintings of smiling Kings and Queens. The most attractive
picture is one of a Prince in shiny armour. By one of the walls there is an
old arm-chair. The only exit is through the aspenwood door to the east.

The Kitchen of Olympus~
This must be the place of food and drink. You can hear the faint noise of 
rats feasting on meat and bread from somewhere undeterminable. The sound
makes you feel the agony of HUNGER. The only visible exit is south to the
Northern end of the hall. To the north there is a larder, and to the east
stands a fridge.

up OR down. It's just a seemingly insurmountable climb, either way. Up is the 
bedroom of Zeus, and Down leads to the Southern end of the hall.

Zeus's Bedroom~
This is a snugly set bedroom with all the necessities for a romantic evening.
A large fireplace adourns the east wall, and sizzling away is the wood that
is ablaze within. The bed is enormous, covering at least HALF of this great
room. This stretches at least 140 square feet, so can you imagine the BED?
A large staircase leads down to the hall. A couple of doors open up to a
broad balcony to the south.

This looks like the cage in which a large carnivore is being kept. Judging by
the state the walls are in, this could very well be a large AGGRESSIVE animal. 
This makes you pretty insecure, this stating your feeling about the place, 
quite mildly.

This place has quite a good view over Technopolis. Your possibilities of
movement seems to extend only to up and down. Unless you want to let go of
the secure and seemingly unmoveable chain, then those are the directions
you should take from here.

The Chain where it's too windy~
Hanging on to the chain you figure out that there's no way of leaving down 
from here. The wind pulls you from left to right and back. This seems like a
totally impossible task. The ascend is the only way ahead for you.
Otherwise you would risk death by falling to the hard ground below. DO NOT
DESCEND NOW OR YOU'LL SURELY DIE!!!!

On the Great Chain of Olympus~
You are approximately on the middle of the treacherous Chain. One false step
and death will come and collect you quickly. The chain leads upwards and down.
No way are you going to descend now... You've only just begun your climb.
Besides it could cost you your life. Look down and you'll see why.~

The Chain~
As you descend, the chain seems to absorbe all weather around it, making it
swing less and less in the very powerful wind tearing at it. The Chain seems
to chuckle quietly, and as you descend further you hear a soft whisper
originating from within the Chain *ITSELF*. 
It says, " Welcome back some other time, stranger. Your company is always
           ... hmmm ... interesting. God Speed. "
The chain extends further down through the now spreading clouds.
