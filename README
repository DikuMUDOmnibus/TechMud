Some things you must be aware of in this mud that differs from standard Diku.
First of all, the shops can produce six items. so when you add shops, make sure
you have six items.  Another is that I put in a hunt command which takes
extra precautions to get it to work.  Go into the lib and read about it.


TechMud is an adaptation of Dikumud, Please read the following that came with
the original DikuMud distribution. The changes made applies to the license

To compile the game, just type 'make', and cross your fingers. So far, the game
has been successfully ported to these machines:

VAX 11/785      - Unix-BSD 4.3 (it was written on one of these babies)
Sun 4           - Unix
Sun 3 (I think) - Unix

plus lots of others... we've lost track.

We are, of course, very interested in expanding this list. If you successfully
compile and run the game on a machine not mentioned above, please send us a 
word.

See doc/running.doc for some hints on how to run the game - and try 'wizhelp'
in the game itself.

If you run into trouble whilst compiling or running the game, we'll be happy
to try and help you out. Send email to:

  quinn@freja.diku.dk or one of the other people from the 'credits' file.
